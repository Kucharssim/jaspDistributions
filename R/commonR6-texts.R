#     intro = gettextf("<h3> Demonstration of the %1$s </h3>
# This demonstration is divided into four parts.
# The first part displays the %1$s, its probability density function, cumulative distribution function, and quantile function.
# The second part allows you to generate data from the %1$s, compute descriptive statistics, and display descriptive plots.
# The third part allows you to estimate the parameters of the %1$s.
# The fourth part allows you to check the fit of the %1$s to the data.
